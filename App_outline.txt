Temperature comparison web application:

Visible Parts:
Header displaying title of page
world map that user can interact with and select a country
submit button
degrees button used to toggle between celcius and fahrenheit
canvas that displays the average annual temperature for two time periods
 of selected country
read me pop up that explains where the data is coming from
 
Under the Hood:
Server(will probably use express but user api is so simple might just use http package):
retrieves information from worldbank
has a function that calculates the average for the retrieved data
retrieve information for map api(need to look more into how this works)
api for interacting with client page:
recieves get requests for initiating this information retrieval
 that have responses with the average for the data

possible extention to utilize some data storage{allow user to save the results in
a local storage or cache to use them to compare different countries

Client:
html document displaying all of the visible parts mentioned above
methods for fetching map and data from the server

Updated gameplan:
add celcius/fahrenheit button, handle errors(country not having data, entering dates
before 1901 or after 2012), add information about where the data comes from and 
explanation of how to use the app(want to do some sort of popup or maybe and introductory
screen that appears while the map is being created and populated)add some css design:
better title, result display, rearrange objects to be more pleasing, work on starting
focus for the map.
